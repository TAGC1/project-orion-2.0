# project-orion-2.0

THIS APP IS NOT FULLY DEVELPOED.

When starting up the app, run the app from the stable branch. The main branch is where we keep bugs and work in progress.  
Then run server.js and the index.js first using NODE. 

EXAMPLE:
node server.js

Afterwards run "ionic serve" to create a virtual app that runs on the webrowser.
